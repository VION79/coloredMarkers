<!-- 

Step 1
As you've seen in the previous projects, webpages should start with a DOCTYPE html declaration, followed by an html element.
Add a DOCTYPE html declaration at the top of the document, and an html element after that. Give the html element a lang 
attribute with en as its value.

Step 2
Nest a head element within the html element. Just after the head element, add a body element.

Step 3
Remember that the title element gives search engines extra information about the page. It also tells browsers what text to 
display in the title bar when the page is open, and on the tab for the page.
Within the head element, nest a title element with the text Colored Markers.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang = "en">
    <head>
        <title>Colored Markers</title>
    </head>
    <body></body>
</html>
