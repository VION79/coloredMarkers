<!-- 

Step 1
As you've seen in the previous projects, webpages should start with a DOCTYPE html declaration, followed by an html element.
Add a DOCTYPE html declaration at the top of the document, and an html element after that. Give the html element a lang 
attribute with en as its value.

Step 2
Nest a head element within the html element. Just after the head element, add a body element.

Step 3
Remember that the title element gives search engines extra information about the page. It also tells browsers what text to 
display in the title bar when the page is open, and on the tab for the page.
Within the head element, nest a title element with the text Colored Markers.

Step 4
To tell browsers how to encode characters on your page, set the charset to utf-8. utf-8 is a universal character set that 
includes almost every character from all human languages.
Inside the head element, nest a meta element with the attribute charset set to utf-8. Remember that meta elements are 
self-closing, and do not need a closing tag.

Step 5
Add another self-closing meta element within the head. Give it a name attribute set to viewport and a content attribute 
set to width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0 so your page looks the same on all devices.

-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang = "en">
    <head>
        <meta charset = utf-8>
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Colored Markers</title>
        

    </head>

<!--
Step 6
Now you're ready to start adding content to the page.
Within the body, nest an h1 element with the text CSS Color Markers.


-->

    <body>
        <h1>CSS Colors Markers</h1>
    </body>
</html>
